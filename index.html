    <h2>Ad Blocker Blocker Blocker (ABBB)</h2><br>br>
    <h4>A simple system for getting rid of the dreaded "Ad blockers violate YouTube's Terms of Service" screen.</h4><br><br><br>
    <h4> Why does this exist?</h4>
    <p>YouTube did a thing where they blocked Invidious from accessing the data of YouTube, because Invidious pretends to be a YouTube Android App, to access videos. YouTube finally realised what Invidious was doing, and all instances are blocked as of writing on the 31/03/2024 (03/31/2024 stupid format). This tool took almost 3 hours to make, and a Chrome extention is coming soon.</p>
    <h4>How to Install</h4>
    <p>As previously mentioned, a Chrome extention is coming soon, so for now, you have to create a bookmark and paste in the following text for the URL:<br><br>javascript:(window.location.href.includes("www.youtube"))?location.href=window.location.href.replace("www.youtube.com","abbblocker.github.io"):console.log("not a youtube page")<br<br>and it should work. All you have to do is go on a youtube watch page and click the button. It also works on the homepage, but if you click it, I think it leads to this page idk.</p>
